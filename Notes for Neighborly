Notes for Neighborly
====================

-Align "<p><a class="btn btn-secondary" href="#" role="button">View details &raquo;</a></p>" so that the buttons are always vertically aligned regardless of text above ----- Perhaps set it in a separate div that is aligned to be a row below 

-Fit images, not stretch

-Provide a signup form in an alert or on separate page
